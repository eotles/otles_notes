I led the University of Wisconsin team to victory in the inaugural [FlexSim - SHS Emergency Department Modeling Competition in 2015](https://www.iise.org/shs/details.aspx?id=48800). This national competition was sponsored by [Flexsim Healthcare](https://healthcare.flexsim.com) and took place at the 2015 Orlando [Society for Health Systems](https://www.iise.org/shs/) conference.

This case competition involved optimizing the operations of an emergency department (ED) using discrete event simulation and operations research tools. The goal was to analyze the Susquehanna Health ED's current operations and determine the best care delivery model to meet productivity requirements while satisfying staffing and care constraints.

We used a combination of discrete event simulation (FlexSim healthcare software), design of experiments, and mathematical programming to determine the ideal care delivery model. See below for a copy of our winning presentation.
