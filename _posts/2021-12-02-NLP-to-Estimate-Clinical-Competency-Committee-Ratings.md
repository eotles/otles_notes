## Abstract
### Objective
Residency program faculty participate in clinical competency committee (CCC) meetings, which are designed to evaluate residentsâ€™ performance and aid in the development of individualized learning plans. In preparation for the CCC meetings, faculty members synthesize performance information from a variety of sources. Natural language processing (NLP), a form of artificial intelligence, might facilitate these complex holistic reviews. However, there is little research involving the application of this technology to resident performance assessments. With this study, we examine whether NLP can be used to estimate CCC ratings.

### Design
We analyzed end-of-rotation assessments and CCC assessments for all surgical residents who trained at one institution between 2014 and 2018. We created models of end-of-rotation assessment ratings and text to predict dichotomized CCC assessment ratings for 16 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Milestones. We compared the performance of models with and without predictors derived from NLP of end-of-rotation assessment text.

### Results
We analyzed 594 end-of-rotation assessments and 97 CCC assessments for 24 general surgery residents. The mean (standard deviation) for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.84 (0.05) for models with only non-NLP predictors, 0.83 (0.06) for models with only NLP predictors, and 0.87 (0.05) for models with both NLP and non-NLP predictors.

### Conclusions
NLP can identify language correlated with specific ACGME Milestone ratings. In preparation for CCC meetings, faculty could use information automatically extracted from text to focus attention on residents who might benefit from additional support and guide the development of educational interventions.
