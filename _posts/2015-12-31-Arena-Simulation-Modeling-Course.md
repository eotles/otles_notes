I developed an online course to introduce the Arena simulation application. Arena is a discrete event simulation tool that is widely used throughout the field of industrial engineering. Despite its frequent use and inclusion in undergraduate curicula it is often not well understood by students. This is due to a lack of high quality training materials.

I taught an in-person simulation lab (ISyE 321) and assisted in teaching a theory of simulation course (ISyE 320) in 2015 at the University of Wisconsin. During this time I developed a series of modules to show off the functionality of Arena. I subsequently recorded these modules and developed a [free online course that is on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGgc6qFmUH8&list=PLK0Zb4OSvWTu1IK01KTrZZQCDsCxHSNJ9).

Here's the first video in the online Arena course that I developed:

If you would like to take a look at my hacky Swift code check out the [Github project](https://github.com/eotles/HCI). <br />

I also developed accompanying presentation slides, exercises, and Arena files. If you are interested in accessing these materials please contact me.
