## Abstract
Primary healthcare is in critical condition with too few students selecting careers, multiple competing demands stressing clinicians, and increasing numbers of elderly patients with multiple health problems. The potential for transdisciplinary research using Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) approaches and methods to study and improve the quality and efficiency of primary care is increasingly recognized. To accelerate the development and application of this research, the National Collaborative to Improve Primary Care through Industrial and Systems Engineering (I-PrACTISE) sponsored an invitational conference in April, 2013 which brought together experts in primary care and ISyE. Seven workgroups were formed, organized around the principles of the Patient Centered Medical Home: Team-Based Care, Coordination and Integration, Health Information Technology (HIT) – Registries and Exchanges, HIT – Clinical Decision Support and Electronic Health Records, Patient Engagement, Access and Scheduling, and Addressing All Health Needs. These groups: (A) Explored critical issues from a primary care perspective and ISyE tools and methods that could address these issues; (B) Generated potential research questions; and (C) Described methods and resources, including other collaborations, needed to conduct this research.
