## Who are you?
I'm [Erkin]({{site.baseurl}/about/)!

## What are you doing?
Primarily training to be a physician-engineer. I also like cooking, eating, traveling, and coding. In addition to long walks on the beach, I also enjoy watching [space documentaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Machines)

## Where?
Currently at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!). Although Wisconsin will always have my heart - Go Badgers!!

## When will you get a real job?
This is my extended family's favorite question. Soon enough. Although my MD-PhD training technically is a job, many thanks to the [NIH](https://nigms.nih.gov/training/instpredoc/Pages/PredocOverview-MSTP.aspx) and US Tax Payers. I've been gainfully employed in the past; it was overrated.

## Why?
idk. Let me know if you figure out the "why of it all."

### Why are you pursuing this training?
That I can answer. Fundamentally, we can advance human health with the power of data. I want to make a small impact by deeply understanding both medicine and engineering. If nothing else, I can serve as a bridge between them, connecting my friends and colleagues on both sides of campus.

## How will you do this?
I'm still figuring it out. But I think there are four key components: learning, doing, disseminating, and connecting. 
- Learning: understand the problems and state of the art deeply (both in medicine and engineering)
- Doing: develop solutions based on that knowledge and test them rigorously in the real world through implementation and continuous evaluation
- Disseminating: sharing knowledge and work helps to scale impact and virtuously feeds learning and doing (I'm trying to improve on this front)
- Connecting: new friends generate new ideas, and networks are powerful tools for accomplishing audacious goals

## Are you open to consulting?
Yes. I am open to artificial intelligence, data science, and health information consulting. Have done all of that in the past. Unfortunately, I have no guarantees on time availability.
