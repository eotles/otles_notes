My research is at the intersection of AI & healthcare, with a focus on the interface between clinical workflows and predictive models. I utilize methods from the domains of clinical informatics, machine learning, and operations research. My work spans the healthcare AI lifecycle with projects advancing from model development/evaluation, technical integration, and connection with clinical workflows.
