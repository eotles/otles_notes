My name is Erkin Ötleş & I’m a physician-engineer (in perpetual training). My mission is to advance health by harnessing the power of data. When I’m not working on AI for healthcare, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and jumping around!

My work is in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine, with specific research interests spanning clinical informatics, machine learning, and operations research. I am a seventh-year Medical Scientist Training Program Fellow (MD-PhD student) at the University of Michigan. My doctoral research focused on creating AI tools for patients, physicians, and health systems. I have led work across the AI lifecycle with projects advancing from model development to validation, technical integration, and workflow implementation. I was co-advised by Dr. Brian Denton (Industrial and Operations Engineering) and Dr. Jenna Wiens (Computer Science and Engineering). I am also interested in incorporating education about AI tools into medical curricula. I have a professional background in health IT development, having worked at Epic and later leading a healthcare data science team. I have a Master’s of Engineering from the University of Wisconsin. After completion of my MD-PhD training, I plan on pursuing residency training.
