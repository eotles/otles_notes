My name is Erkin Ötleş & I’m a physician-engineer (in perpetual training). My mission is to advance health by harnessing the power of data. When I’m not working on AI for healthcare, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and jumping around!

My work is in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine, with specific research interests spanning clinical informatics, machine learning, and operations research. I am a seventh-year Medical Scientist Training Program Fellow (MD-PhD student) at the University of Michigan. My doctoral research focused on creating AI tools for patients, physicians, and health systems. I have led work across the AI lifecycle with projects advancing from model development to validation, technical integration, and workflow implementation. I was co-advised by Dr. Brian Denton (Industrial and Operations Engineering) and Dr. Jenna Wiens (Computer Science and Engineering).

I am also interested in incorporating education about AI tools into medical curricula. I have a professional background in health IT development, having worked at Epic and later leading a healthcare data science team. I have a Master’s of Engineering from the University of Wisconsin. After completion of my MD-PhD training, I plan on pursuing residency training.

Medical Scientist Training Program
MD expected May 2024

Medicine has been a central aspect of my journey and has profoundly shaped my professional and personal interests. 

I started my medical training as a Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) Fellow at the University of Michigan in 2016. The Michigan MSTP is a National Institute of Health-funded program designed to train physician-scientists by integrating medical education with scientific training. Graduates have an MD and a PhD and may work as physicians and/or researchers in academia, private practice, or industry. In addition to rigorous training, the Michigan MSTP has allowed me to work with and mentor other physician-scientists in training. I was a founding editor of "The Pipette," the semi-official Michigan MSTP journal (newsletter). The program even let me co-chair our 2021 annual scientific retreat.

In my first two years in the program, I completed my medical school didactic and core clinical coursework. This exposure to real-life clinical decision-making and hands-on experience in patient care greatly informed my PhD research. I was able to draw on my clinical knowledge to develop data-driven solutions to pressing healthcare problems. Additionally,  clinical needs remained an essential driver of my research focus. Working closely with physician-researchers was one of the best aspects of my PhD training.

After defending my dissertation, I returned to medical school. I am currently an "M3" and am trying to decide on my clinical specialty. Procedural specialties that allow for a balance between research and clinical duty, such as anesthesia, Emergency Medicine, and Ophthalmology, are on my shortlist.


I have found clinical medicine to be challenging and rewarding. There are many challenges to tackle, ranging from imperfect information to operational issues to poor software design. It can be daunting! However, building clinical decision-making and procedural skills and utilizing these skills in service of humankind has been immensely gratifying.
